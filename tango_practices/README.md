When I use the function of taurusform, I have found that, some device servers do not work well, such as tango test, and Starter.  These have no function on the sardana server. All in sardana and spock work well.
I have spent lots of time to check the problem. Therefore, I have learned somthing about tango control,  how to operate the tango device servers or devices in jive, and also astor.
