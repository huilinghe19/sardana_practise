1. set path of macros in Spock: _MACRO_SERVER.put_property({"MacroPath":["/hone/huiling/sardana/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples"]})
2. Problem: image can not shown in spock. Hinweis:'TypeError: 'figure' is an unknown keyword argument
(For more detailed information type: python_error)'
3. 'plotting_huiling.py' works well. It is from: https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana/blob/develop/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples/plotting.py , which is verbunden with the macro 'random_image'. I habe imported matplotlib directly and changed the commands in the method 'random_image'. 
I can use the macros from https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana/blob/develop/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples/plotting.py ,The macros can be automatic added in the macro server. For example, ask_for_moveable, ask_number_of_points, which can work well. Just the plot function don't work well. Perhaps the reason of the macro random_image is that, I have not configured the macro server path correctly. Because the installed Sardana version is in root,  but I set the path using  '_MACRO_SERVER.put_property({"MacroPath":["/hone/huiling/sardana/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples"]})'. The path of '/hone/huiling/sardana/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples" is not the real path from the installed sardana version. In the tutorial, the path is set to the path as '/sardana/src/sardana/macroserver/macros/examples', which I think is the real sardana installation path.
